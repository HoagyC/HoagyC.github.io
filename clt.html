The central limit theorem tells us that the distribution of sample means where each sample is a sequence taken from independent and identically distributed variables of finite variance forms a distribution that approaches in the limit a normal distribution with mean \[\mu\] and variance \[\frac{\sigma^2}{n}\].

What I want to look at is the opposite direction: if we see a variable that appears to be normally distributed, what can we infer about the process that produced it; what should we take as our prior about

The first thing to recognise is that many other standard distributions approximate the normal distribution. The binomial and poisson distributions, with sufficiently large n and \[lambda\] repsectively, also approximate this

In genetics, we see that height is normally distributed. At the other extreme, we have the example of IQ which has been deliberately shaped to produce a bell curve. This curve therefore tells us nothing about the way that this variable is produced, and so when receiving a black-box normal variable we can't rule anything out.
