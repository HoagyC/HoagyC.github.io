        <p><a href="https://timeglo.be">timeglo.be</a> is a website I had wanted to build for a long time and which was completed with Misha Wagner and Joe Groocock in 2016.</p>
<p>It scrapes the Wikipedia &quot;On this day&quot; section to create a databse of time-stamped events. The descriptions of these events are checked against a database of placenames to attach co-ordinates. This database can be accessed through a search function by keyword and date with the events placed onto an interactive 3D globe.</p>
