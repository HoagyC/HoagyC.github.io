Occurs to me that the core element of computing substrate is simply arbitrarily controllable matter. Once you have this control then you cna implement your core functional forms but really the control (including output to center if necessary)  seems all that's necessary. I think this is why it is fair to say that the universe will eventually be converted into computronium.
