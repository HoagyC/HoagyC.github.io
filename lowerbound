At the foundations of macroecononomics we have two very important graphs. One shows the way in which the total saving in an economy depends on the real interest rate. The other shows the way in which the total investment depends on the real interest rate. When the interest rate goes up, saving becomes omre worthwhile, and so the total savings goes up. At the same time, a higher interest rate means that fewer investment projects give an expected return that exceeds the interest that must be paid on the loan, and so investment falls. This naturally defines an equilibrium interest rate, and because this equilibrium point may change depending on variables like the overall health of the economy and the inflation rate, this defines a equilibrium given a range of other variables, which is central to the standard macroeconomic analysis.

Let us examine the graph that gives us the equilbrium. It is clear that the level of saving is well defined. As interest rates rise, saving should rise in a monotonic fashion- it we can double our money in a year saving would be far more attractive. At the other end of the spectrum, even if interest rates were extremely low, saving would still be useful as a hedge against changes in income, and if interest rates became negative, saving would still exist, though the ratio of banks to private safes would decrease.

On the other hand, the investment saving curve

We can visualise this with a graph that shows the divergence as we zoom out between .bb
