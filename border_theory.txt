Since I've got to work here, might as well do some proper thinking on what borders should look like.

We do have flexibility of border when we have things like road blocks, these happen in war, in response to specfic emergencies, larger temporary borders like in response to the migrant crisis which then escalated to be semi-permanent national borders.
