Notes from reading up on modern theories of meaning

Everything is defined relative to a world-model (potentially, universe in the Grothendieck sense?)
Even the standard quantifiers from Frege presuppose a world in which there are particular boundaries between objects, unifmrom kinds of relations, and groups of objects. We're therefore not describing the world specifically so much as applying these concepts to our simplified mental model (though many of these concepts could be fleshed out in a logically consistent way based on the true territory).
