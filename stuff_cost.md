How much do things cost?

A question naively thought to be complicated, but which turns out to be rather simple. The UK's total trade in goods is currently worth about £870B each year. The total weight of these goods is about 580 million tonnes. Things (wholesale) therefore cost about £1.50/kg. 

Further work is underway using inflation data to measure how big things are. I await my call from the Office for National Statistics.
