[timeglo.be](https://timeglo.be) is a website I had wanted to build for a long time and which was completed with Misha Wagner and Joe Groocock in 2016.

It scrapes the Wikipedia \"On this day\" section to create a databse of time-stamped events. The descriptions of these events are checked against a database of placenames to attach co-ordinates. This database can be accessed through a search function by keyword and date with the events placed onto an interactive 3D globe.
