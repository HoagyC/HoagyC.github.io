<p>This post is my full writeup of the exercises in this <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/svE3S6NKdPYoGepzq/topological-fixed-point-exercises">post.</a></p>

1.
(1-D Sperner's lemma) Consider a path built out of n edges as shown. Color each vertex blue or green such that the leftmost vertex is blue and the rightmost vertex is green. Show that an odd number of the edges will be bichromatic.

     <br>
      With length two there this is clearly true. When we add a node between two other nodes, if it is a different colour to both adjacent nodes then two new bichromatic vertices are introduced, else the number of such vertices stays the same. All sequences can be generated by successive addition of nodes in this way therefore by induction there will always be an odd number of bichromatic vertices.

      2.
<p>
      (Intermediate value theorem) The Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem states that any bounded sequence in \(\textbb{R}^n\) has a convergent subsequence. The intermediate value theorem states that if you have a continuous function \(f:[0,1]\rightarrow\mathbb{R}\) such that \(f(0)\leq 0\) and \(f(1)\geq 0\), then there exists an \(x\in[0,1]\) such that \(f(x)=0\). Prove the intermediate value theorem. It may be helpful later on if your proof uses 1-D Sperner's lemma and the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem.</p>
  <p>
      You can map the continuous function \(f(x)\) to a path of the kind found in Question 1 of length n+1 
by evaluating \(f(x)\) at \(x=0\), \(x=1\) and n-1 equally spaced divisions between these two points and setting a node as blue if \(f(x)<0\) else as green.

By Sperner's Lemma there is an odd, and therefore non-zero number of b-g vertices. You can then take any b-g pair of nodes as the starting points for a new path and repeat the process. After k iterations you have two values of \(x\) - only one where \(f(x)\) is below zero - that are \(\frac{1}{n^k}\) away from each other. We thus can find arbitrarily close points that straddle zero. By taking the sequence \(f(x)\) of initial nodes x we get a sequence that, by B-W, has a sub-sequence which converges to zero. By continuity we have proved the existence of an \(x\) such that \(f(x)=0\).
