How much do things cost?

A question often thought to be complicated, but which turns out to be rather simple. The UK's total trade in goods is currently worth about £870B each year. The total weight of these goods is about 580 million tonnes. Things (wholesale) therefore cost about £1.5/kg. Inflation data to measure the size of things shortly forthcoming. I await my call from the Office for National Statistics.
